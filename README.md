# Ryan's Job Search

Driven by the indeed API, I wanted to create a functional implementation using Angular(2/4).

To make things even more simple, I will be using Heroku as my hosting provider. 

## Work in Progress
This project will continue to be a work in progress, even post-release. If anyone out there would like to contribute, please fork, make your changes and add a pull request accordingly.
