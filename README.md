# Ryan's Job Search

Driven by the indeed API, I wanted to create a functional implementation using Angular(2/4).

To make things even more simple, I will be using Heroku as my hosting provider. 

## Work in Progress
This project will continue to be a work in progress, even post-release. If anyone out there would like to contribute, please fork, make your changes and add a pull request accordingly. 

## Before Starting
Before you run this example, you need to set up an Indeed publisher account and add your publisher ID as a local environment variable:
1. linux/unix: in your .bashrc file `export INDEED_PUB=xxxxxxxxxxxx`
2. macos/osx: in your .bash_profile `export INDEED_PUB=xxxxxxxxxxxx`


## Running with Proxy Settings
After setting your publisher id in your local environment, run the example with `npm start`
